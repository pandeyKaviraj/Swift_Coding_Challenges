Swift Coding Challenges: Strings
This repository contains solutions to 10 coding problems related to Strings in Swift programming. These problems are designed to test your understanding of various String operations in Swift, such as manipulating Strings, finding substrings, and working with Unicode.

Problems
Each problem is contained in a separate Swift file in the Sources folder. The file name corresponds to the problem number. For example, Problem1.swift contains the solution to the first problem. Here's a list of the problems:

Write a function that accepts a String and returns the number of words in the String.
Write a function that accepts two Strings and returns true if they are anagrams, false otherwise.
Write a function that accepts a String and returns the reverse of the String.
Write a function that accepts a String and returns true if the String is a palindrome, false otherwise.
Write a function that accepts a String and a character, and returns true if the String contains the character, false otherwise.
Write a function that accepts two Strings and returns true if the first String contains all the characters in the second String, false otherwise.
Write a function that accepts two Strings and returns true if they are rotations of each other, false otherwise.
Write a function that accepts a String and returns the most common character in the String.
Write a function that accepts a String and returns the second most common character in the String.
Write a function that accepts a String and returns a new String with each word reversed.
